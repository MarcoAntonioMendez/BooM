# BooM
BooM is a light gun video game for PC, the game gets its inspiration from the legendary DooM series.
You can watch a small gameplay in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynAB7gpe4cQ 
This project was made for a class I had in university.

The idea was to develop a video game similar to Duck Hunt but with the atmosphere of and feeling of Doom.
I decided to code the game in java because I wanted to increase my expertise in that language.

Most of the resources I used belonged to the video game Doom (2016), so I do not own nor have the rights
of anything (images, music, sfx etc).

Note: Make sure you read the file: "0link_to_the_rest_of_songs" located in "BooM/resources/sounds/" so
you can understand and run the software in your computer in case you want to.
